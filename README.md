# SEOaudit
This project is intended to scan and analyze the most important pages of a given website. 
The aspects examined are relevant for SEO (Search Engine Optimization) purposes.
The script checks for and prints the Title, H1 tag, and Meta-Description of each web page.
In addition, Google Dev Tools "Lighthouse" tool is used to determine the performance score of a page's loading time.
The results are saved in a xlsx (excel) file.

For practice purposes, I used the script to determine the New York Times main pages SEO values. The main pages I chose are the pages 
 accessible from the navigation bar on the homepage.
